    "content": "One of Google’s Super Bowl ads features a Wisconsin cheese market owner who uses the company’s Gemini AI tool to write product descriptions. But cheese fans quickly caught a hole in a previous version last week.\n\nThe AI-generated copy in the commercial claimed that Gouda accounts “for 50 to 60 percent of the world’s consumption.” An X user quickly pointed out that that’s incorrect. (“Cheddar & mozzarella would like a word,” the user added.)\n\nThough widely used since the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022, generative AI still is prone to churning out inaccurate and oftentimes wacky results. Google’s AI-generated search results came under fire when it provided misleading information, such as falsely claiming that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim. Other users pointed out last year the tool recommended adding glue on pizza to help the cheese stick.\n\nGoogle is in the middle of a push to incorporate its Gemini AI technology across its suite of products in a race to keep up with its US AI competitors OpenAI and Meta, as well as new competitors in China.\n\nThe new advertisement from Google features a Wisconsin cheese market owner using Google's Gemini AI tool to write product descriptions. This version doesn't have the gaffe pointed out by social media users.\nThe new advertisement from Google features a Wisconsin cheese market owner using Google's Gemini AI tool to write product descriptions. This version doesn't have the gaffe pointed out by social media users. From Google\nOn X, Google Cloud executive Jerry Dischler said that the gaffe wasn’t a hallucination – which is when an AI model produces inaccurate or misleading results. Rather, he said “multiple sites across the web include the 50-60% stat.”\n\nIn a statement, Google said it had updated the commercial. The statistic is erased from the commercial currently uploaded on Google-owned YouTube.\n\n\n“After the question came up about the Gouda stat, we spoke with the owner of the Wisconsin Cheese Mart to ask him how he would handle. Following his suggestion to have Gemini rewrite the product description without the stat, we updated the UI to reflect what the business would do,” a Google spokesperson said Thursday.\n\nWhen Googling “gouda cheese consumption,” the first result that comes up is the 50-60% statistic from a site called Cheese.com. However, it’s hard to find another website that uses that number, and the statistic has long been debated on the internet.\n\nThe Wisconsin ad was part of a series of 50 commercials from 50 different states’ small businesses that show how they use Google Workspace with Gemini.",

    "content": "The US economy kicked off 2025 by adding 143,000 jobs in January, fewer than expected; but the unemployment rate dipped to 4%, according to data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEconomists were projecting the unemployment rate would stay at 4.1% and 170,000 jobs would be added, according to FactSet estimates.\n\nWhile cold and severe weather as well as the wildfires in Los Angeles were expected to be influential factors on January’s report, they had “no discernible effect” on last month’s payroll numbers, earnings, hours worked or the unemployment rate, BLS officials noted.\n\nFriday’s report also provided more clarity on recent labor market trends, indicating that job growth last year was weaker than previously estimated.\n\nThe latest benchmark revision — an annual process that squares up estimates — showed there were 589,000 fewer jobs added to the economy in 2024.\n\nAccounting for the revisions, there were just shy of 2 million jobs added last year, amounting to roughly 166,000 jobs per month — a pace practically equal to what was seen in 2019.\n\nIn the years following the economy-upheaving pandemic, the labor market has slowed, but it has not collapsed. Growth has remained solid enough to fuel consumer spending and put the economy on track for a “soft landing” of reining in inflation without triggering a recession.\n\nBut there’s been some heightened concern in recent months: Job gains have slowed not because of mass layoffs, but because hiring activity has fallen off significantly.\n\nBecause of that, if there were to be a sudden turn in the economy, there would be little buffer for businesses to make a change, economists warn, noting companies are already “hiring like they’re in a recession.”"

    "content": "\nIn an effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce, the Trump administration is prodding government employees to shift to the private sector for the next stage of their careers. But it may not be that simple.\n\nEligible federal workers initially had until Thursday to accept the administration’s deferred resignation offer, which would allow them to quit while still being paid through September — but a federal judge paused the deadline on Thursday afternoon.\n\n“We encourage you to find a job in the private sector as soon as you would like to do so,” the Office of Personnel Management said in an FAQ about the offer. “The way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.”\n\nBut there’s one important factor that federal employees need to keep in mind: It’s not so easy to get private-sector job these days, economists say.\n\n“There has been remarkably little hiring taking place lately,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. “You actually have quite a static job market at the moment without that many opportunities for people to make a switch.”\n\nThe latest government data reaffirmed the job market’s relatively lethargic condition. The number of job openings fell more than expected in December, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, which was released Tuesday. Hiring remained soft.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s taking more time for the unemployed to land new positions, with job seekers typically spending 10.4 weeks on the hunt compared to eight or nine weeks for much of 2022 and 2023, Pollak said. And the share of the long-term unemployed, who have been out of work for at least six months, has also been on the rise.\n\nTo be sure, some federal workers will have an easier time finding a private-sector post, said Ron Hetrick, senior labor economist at Lightcast, a labor market data company. Those with cybersecurity experience or with security clearances, for instance, would probably get scooped up fairly quickly.\n\nBut those with administrative experience may find it more challenging to transition.\n\n“It’s not exactly a hot job market for professional roles,” he said, noting that there is already a lot of competition for these jobs and the deferred resignation offer will likely add more people to the pool of candidates.\n\nTens of thousands opt in\nMore than 50,000 people have decided to take the deferred retirement package, a Trump administration official told CNN on Thursday. Those who don’t take it are at risk of being laid off, OPM has warned.\n\nThe offer is one of several steps the Trump administration is taking to overhaul and downsize the federal workforce.\n\nFederal employee unions have urged their members to reject the incentive, questioning its legality and the Trump administration’s ability to fulfill its promises. They note that the federal government is funded only through mid-March so the administration can’t offer to pay workers through September at this time.\n\nThe judge’s pause stems from a lawsuit that the American Federation of Government Employees and several other unions filed in US District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday seeking a temporary restraining order to halt the February 6 deadline.\n\nFewer remote work opportunities\nPresident Donald Trump’s mandate that federal workers return to the office full time may prod some of those who want to continue teleworking to consider the package. But these types of positions are tough to find in the private market, Hetrick said, with remote openings attracting twice the number of applicants as in-person listings.\n\nAnother challenge: Federal employees skew older, and it’s often harder for these workers to find new employment, Pollak said. Some 28% are ages 55 and older, compared to just under 24% of the overall workforce, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nStill, the federal workforce does have some advantages. They tend to be more educated and could be quite attractive to employers who have government contracts, Pollak said.\n\nAlso, the eight months of paid leave federal staffers have been offered could give them time to hunt for a new position. They should use that time to expand their network and learn how to market themselves, Hetrick said.\n\n“You can’t rely on the job market being better, but you can be better,” he said.",

    "content": "US officials kept around 100 deported Indian migrants in shackles for their 40-hour flight home, including during bathroom breaks, in the latest incident to spark anger overseas at President Donald Trump’s migration crackdown.\n\nIndian lawmakers demonstrated outside parliament on Thursday, some wearing shackles and others mocking the much-touted friendship between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nElsewhere in New Delhi, members of the youth wing of India’s main opposition party burned an effigy of Trump.\n\nLast month, the spectacle of Colombian deportees being shackled as they boarded a US deportation flight sparked a bitter dispute between the two countries, with Colombian president Gustavo Petro initially refusing the military plane permission to land.\n\nThe anger in India comes days ahead of an expected visit by Modi to meet Trump – whom he has called a “true friend” – at the White House.\n\nS. Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, a government minister in the western state of Punjab, where the deportation flight landed, urged Modi to “now use his friendship to resolve the issue.”\n\nDhaliwal also questioned “the usefulness of this friendship if it cannot help Indian citizens in need,” his office said in a statement.\n\nThe flight to India was the longest in distance since the Trump administration began deploying military aircraft for migrant deportations, according to a US official.\n\n“Our hands were cuffed and ankles tied with chains before we took the flight,” said 23-year-old Akashdeep Singh, who arrived in Punjab on Wednesday with 103 other deportees.\n\n“We requested the military officials to take it off to eat or go to the bathroom but they treated us horribly and without any regard whatsoever,” Singh added.\n\n“The way they looked at us, I’ll never forget it… We went to the bathroom with the shackles on. Right before landing, they removed (the shackles) for the women. We saw it. For us, they were removed after we landed by the local police officials.”\n\nUS Border Patrol Chief Michael W. Banks posted a video of the Indian deportees being put onto a plane on X. In the video, shackles are seen on the wrists and ankles of several men who shuffle slowly up the ramp.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Pentagon and US Customs and Border Protection for comment on whether the deportees were held in shackles for the duration of the flight.",

    "content": "A pair of US lawmakers are seeking to ban government workers from using Chinese startup DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence chatbot on official devices.\n\nReps. Darin LaHood, a Republican from Illinois, and Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, are set to propose legislation on Friday that would ban the use of DeepSeek on government devices over national security concerns.\n\nDeepSeek is just the latest target in a larger battle for tech supremacy between the United States and China.\n\nThe attempted crackdown comes weeks after DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and Wall Street by releasing an advanced AI model, called R1, with the same capabilities as top American models, despite being cheaper to train and less power-hungry. The model — from a year-old Chinese startup subject to US export restrictions on the most powerful AI chips — has fueled concerns that the United States could fall behind China in AI.\n\nChinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek is forcing Silicon Valley to reconsider its plans for developing AI technology.\nRelated article\nWhy DeepSeek could mark a turning point for Silicon Valley on AI\n\nIf passed, the proposed bill would give 60 days for government agencies to develop standards and guidelines for removing DeepSeek — as well as any other app developed by its parent company, High Flyer — from official devices.\n\nThe proposal follows similar moves by Australia, Italy and Taiwan.\n\nDeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe language in the proposed bill also echoes the legislation that has sought to restrict access to TikTok in the United States over worries that its China-based owner, ByteDance, could be forced to share sensitive US user data with the Chinese government.\n\nFederal and state government agencies began banning the use of TikTok on official devices starting in 2022. And ByteDance now has fewer than 60 days to sell the app before TikTok is banned in the United States, because of a law that was passed with bipartisan support last year and extended by President Donald Trump in January.\n\n“The Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans,” Gottheimer said in a statement. “We simply can’t risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security … We’ve seen China’s playbook before with TikTok, and we cannot allow it to happen again.”\n\nMany AI companies use the inputs from users’ conversations with chatbots to train and improve their models, stoking privacy concerns. But security experts have already cautioned that DeepSeek could pose a bigger risk because of its Chinese owner.\n\n“Users need to be aware that any data shared with the platform could be subject to government access under China’s cybersecurity laws, which mandate that companies provide access to data upon request by authorities,” NordVPN cybersecurity expert Adrianus Warmenhoven said in emailed commentary.\n\nRelated\n\n",
