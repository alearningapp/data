  "content": "Dear Alice, How are you? I draw some pictures for you.\nThey are about my family.\nIn the first picture, I am cooking an egg and I am happy.\nIn the second picture, Dad and my sister are fishing.\nThey catch two fish and one crab.\nThey are excited! In the third picture, my brother is riding a bike in the park.\nHe is thirsty.\nHe wants to drink some water.\nIn the last picture, my little sister is dancing.\nShe is singing a song too.\nMum is blowing up a balloon for her.\nWhat do you do with your family? Write back soon.\nBest, Franky"
