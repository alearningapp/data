  "content": "We live on a farm. We have lots of animals. My favourite animal is Walter. He is a pig.\n\nThis Christmas, Dad built a manger for my school's Christmas play. A manger is a big box that holds food for cows. Jesus slept in a manger when he was just born.\n\nOne day, my friends came over to practise singing Christmas songs. Afterwards. we decided to go for a sleigh ride. We went out to the barn to get the sleigh.\n\nDad opened the big barn door. He turned on the lights. There.\n\nnestled in the manger full of hay, was a very sleepy Walter He raised his head. He could barely open his eyes. We all laughed so hard that we nearly fell over.\n\nWalter went right back to sleep. It made us laugh even harder.\n\nSince then, he has been known as Waller, the Christmas Pig.\n",
