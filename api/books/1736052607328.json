  "content": "After school, I usually go home with my friends.\nWe walk together, and sometimes we talk about our day.\nWhen I get home, I have a snack.\nMy favorite is a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\nIt's so yummy! Then, I do my homework.\nSometimes, it's a little tricky, but I always try my best.\nI know that doing homework is important.Once my homework is done, I like to play outside.\nI ride my bike or play with my dog in the yard.\nIt's so much fun!"
