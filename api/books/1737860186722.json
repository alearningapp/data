  "content": "\nDr.Miller broke his ankle. \"I don't understand how I broke it,\" he told his friends. \"I was walking in the woods when I stepped into a hole. But, I don't think | twisted it enough to break it.\"\n\n\"Now you get to see what it's like to be a patient,\" his wife told him.\n\nFinally, Dr.Miller's ankle got better and he could walk normally again.\n\nOne day, he said, \"I'm going for a walk in the woods to see if I can figure out how I broke my ankle in that hole.\"\n\nDr.Miller found the hole. He looked at it from every angle, but he still couldn't figure out how he had broken his ankle.\nHe stuck his foot down the hole. Just then, he slipped and broke his ankle all over again!",
